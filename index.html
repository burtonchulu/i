	About me
	</h4>
	<p id="p2">
	Hi.My name is Burton and i am a web technology lover from Gweru Zimbabwe.I love coding so much that i get sad if a day goes by without me doing it.I discovered web development in 2016 and since then i have been practising and i have mastered some impressive skills.Before web development i had studied Metallurgy at college but since then i have decided on a complete career change.
	I intend to be an excellent and top front end developer and i dont intend anything to stop me in that regard.I aim to be working for a top design house in the next two years, so if you have an opening try me.
	I am also a gardening lover as i love things that grow.The patience,effort,care necessary in gardening together with the satisfaction that comes with seeing all the hardwork paying off is what draws me to gardening.I get the same satistaction from seeing a website slowly coming to life.
